# AverageFlightDelay

A simple web application, that takes a **year** and **airport IATA code** from user as input, 
then downloads a file from http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html containing needed data 
about flights in USA for given year
and computes the average delay of fligths to a given airport in that year.
